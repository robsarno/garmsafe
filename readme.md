# About Garmsafe+
We're a AZIENDA that is CREATA during work-related learning hours.
We focus on DISABILITA' and above all on blinds. We're creating a COSA STRANA for blinds that helps them to "SEE" even if they don't SEE.

### COSA STRANA: Blindstrip
![](http://garmsafe.altervista.org/aaaaNONCancellare/blindstrip-iloveimg-resized.png)
The name of "COSA STRANA" is Blindstrip, a strip for blinds, easy, isn't it?
It is composed by a stoffa, wires, distance sensors and vibration motors.
It vibrates when you are near to an obstacle and it also gives you a coffee if you don't collide with it.
